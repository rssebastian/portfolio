## Acknowledgements

- [Adrian Hajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin) - Many thanks to his [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HNyXCPDQ7Q) showing me how to implement Framer Motion and how to use Sanity.io for easy content management. The color palette has been changed and other design modifications were made, but I give Adrian credit for providing the foundation for me to showcase my skills.
